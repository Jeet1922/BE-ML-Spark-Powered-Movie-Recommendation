# Apache Spark

This repository contains a complete setup to run Apache Spark in Google Colab, allowing you to explore distributed data processing, analytics, and transformations without needing a Spark cluster locally.

## 🚀 What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark is designed to process large-scale data efficiently, both in batch and real-time environments.

---

## 🔥 Why Spark?

### ✅ Speed

Spark performs in-memory processing which makes it **up to 100x faster** than traditional systems like Hadoop MapReduce.

### ✅ Scalability

Spark is built to handle **terabytes to petabytes** of data across distributed clusters.

### ✅ Flexibility

Supports a wide variety of workloads:

* Batch Processing
* Interactive Queries (Spark SQL)
* Machine Learning (MLlib)
* Stream Processing (Spark Streaming)
* Graph Processing (GraphX)

### ✅ Unified Engine

A single platform for different types of big data workloads.

## 📚 Example Use Case: Netflix Recommendation System

Imagine Netflix wants to generate daily movie recommendations for millions of users based on watch history, search patterns, and user interactions.

**Data Size:**

* \~500 million users
* 10+ years of history
* Billions of events per day

### Why Spark Works:

* Distributes data and computation across multiple nodes
* Caches frequent queries in memory for fast retrieval
* Efficiently handles data joins, aggregations, and filtering at massive scale
* Real-time pipeline integration with tools like Kafka

> 💡 Traditional tools like Pandas or Excel fail beyond a few gigabytes of data. Spark is designed to thrive in this environment.

## 🧪 What's in This Project

This Google Colab-based setup includes:

* ✅ Java and PySpark installation
* ✅ Spark environment configuration
* ✅ Spark session creation
* ✅ Reading a CSV file with Spark
* ✅ Displaying and inspecting the DataFrame

---

## 📁 Sample Data

```csv
id,name,department,salary
1,Alice,Engineering,70000
2,Bob,Sales,50000
3,Charlie,HR,45000
4,David,Engineering,80000
5,Eva,Marketing,60000
```

You can modify or scale this data to simulate big data scenarios using Spark's `union()` operations.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the steps: Install Java, install PySpark, set environment variables.
3. Create and initialize a Spark session.
4. Load and explore the CSV using Spark.

## 📌 When Should You Use Spark?

| Scenario                                  | Spark Needed?       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CSV with 1,000 rows                       | ❌ Pandas is enough  |
| 10 million+ rows from logs or sensors     | ✅ Yes               |
| Real-time fraud detection                 | ✅ Yes               |
| Joining huge datasets (e.g., sales + CRM) | ✅ Yes               |
| Exploratory data analysis on small data   | ❌ Use Pandas or SQL |

PROJECT DETAILS:
-------------------------------------------------------
🏗️ Step 1: Project Architecture Overview
Here’s the full architecture layout for the project:

📦 Modules:
Data Ingestion Layer (CSV files / databases / APIs)

Spark Data Processing Layer (ETL)

Feature Engineering Layer (user behavior, ratings, watch history)

Modeling Layer (recommendation algorithm - collaborative filtering via ALS)

Data Storage Layer (final transformed tables for visualization)

BI Layer (Power BI or a React/Flask dashboard for visualization)

🧾 Step 3: Tables Required (CSV or Mock DB)
Table Name	Description
users.csv	Basic user details (id, name, age, location, etc.)
movies.csv	Movie details (id, title, genre, release year, etc.)
ratings.csv	User ratings (user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp)
watch_history.csv	Timestamps when users watched movies (user_id, movie_id, watch_time)
search_logs.csv	What users searched for (user_id, keyword, timestamp)

🔧 Step 4: Spark Data Manipulation Tasks
Module	Tasks
Ingestion	Read multiple CSVs, merge schema, handle corrupt records
Cleaning	Null value handling, deduplication, data type casting
Feature Engineering	Average rating per user/movie, watch frequency, search trends, genre preferences
Model Training	Use ALS (Alternating Least Squares) for collaborative filtering
Export	Store results in Parquet or CSV format for Power BI or API access

📊 Step 5: Data Model for Power BI
Table	Purpose
final_user_features.parquet	User-level embeddings & features
final_movie_features.parquet	Movie-level embeddings & genre vectors
recommendations.parquet	Top-N movie recommendations for each user
aggregated_insights.csv	Summary stats (avg ratings, most watched genres, etc.)

💻 Optional: Frontend Integration (Instead of Power BI)
You can expose:

/get-recommendations?user_id=123 – through a REST API (Flask/FastAPI)

Frontend (React) pulls recommendations and renders them in a clean UI

✅ Tools Used
Purpose	Tool
Data Processing	Apache Spark with PySpark
Notebook Development	Google Colab
Storage	CSV/Parquet
Modeling	ALS from Spark MLlib
Dashboard	Power BI or React + Flask
Data Visualization	Matplotlib (optional), Power BI
Ingestion Automation	Scheduled Notebooks/Scripts
